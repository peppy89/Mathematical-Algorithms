# Exercise 11 – FIR Filter Types (I–IV)

## Overview
This project explores the **four types of linear-phase FIR filters** using MATLAB.  
For each filter (Types I–IV), we plot:
- **Magnitude response** |H(e^{jω})|
- **Phase response** (unwrapped)
- **Pole–Zero diagram**

We also investigate how the **filter length M** affects the transition band and overall response.
